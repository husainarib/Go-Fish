            <h2>How to play Go Fish!</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 6 players can play.</li>
        <li>Deal 5 cards to each player (or 7 cards if only 2 or 3 players).</li>
        <li>The rest of the cards go in a pile in the middle of the table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Goal:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your goal is to collect 4 cards of the same number (like four 3s or four Kings).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Play:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>On your turn, ask any other player for a card by saying something like, "Do you have any 5s?"</li>
        <li>If they have the card you asked for, they give you all of those cards.</li>
        <li>If they don’t have it, they’ll say, “Go Fish!” and you’ll pick a card from the pile in the middle.</li>
        <li>If you pick the card you asked for, you get to go again. If not, it's the next player's turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making a Set:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you collect all 4 cards of the same number (like four 7s), put them face-up on the table. That’s called a "book."</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Winning:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game ends when all the cards are used up or all the books are made.</li>
        <li>The player with the most books at the end is the winner!</li>
    </ul>
